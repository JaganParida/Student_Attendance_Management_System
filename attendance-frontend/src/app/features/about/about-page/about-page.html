    <p>
      The Student Attendance Management System is a digital platform developed to simplify and automate the process of recording and managing student attendance in educational institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traditionally, attendance is marked manually on paper, which is time-consuming, prone to errors, and difficult to maintain over time. This system replaces that old method with a smart, computerized approach that ensures accuracy, transparency, and easy access to data.
